# angular-filter
coding exercise to create an alphabetic filter in angularjs

For the sake of this exercise, a flat html file has ben created from the application under development. All the dependencies are inside the iQ4_files folder.

When you open the file in your browser, you should see a panel called "Browse Engagements", and the alphabet underneath it. Your task is to implement filtering functionality for the results underneath. Don't worry about the "Your Engagements" column on the left. Make any modifications you think are necessary to HTML, CSS, or JS.

Please create a new branch and a Pull request when ready.
